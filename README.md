## Nandos - https://emmanuelojiji.github.io/nandos

After seeing much demand on Twitter for Nando's to introduce a
cocktail menu, I developed a landing page for a Nando's cocktail
launch.

I posted this prank on Twitter as a marketing strategy to promote
my Web Development skills. It received over 14,000 likes, and over
2,000 retweets. 

Many were impressed at the skill, but also angry it
wasn't real! It caused a huge frenzy.

It was reposted by popular
brands, and also received attention from the ofcial Nando's
account.
